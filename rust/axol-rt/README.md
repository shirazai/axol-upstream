# axol-rt

Realtime CAN control core for the Almond Axol arms, in Rust. This is the
"fast half" of the hybrid teleop architecture: Python keeps VR ingest, IK
(JAX), MuJoCo gravity/inertia, and the web/serve stack; Rust owns the CAN
buses and runs the per-tick control loop with hard, GIL-free timing.

`axol teleop` and every other production arm-motion flow use it
unconditionally: `gravity-comp`, `waypoints`, `tune.motion`,
`tune.repeatability`, and the LeRobot-based `collect-data`, `run-policy`, and
`replay-dataset` commands. Once armed, the core is the only CAN consumer.
Bench/calibration flows that need direct register access (`tune.pid`,
`tune.friction`, `motor.*`) remain maintenance tools outside the production
control loop. Their timed PID/friction experiments nevertheless execute in
Rust through the proxy's experiment engine; Python only plans gravity/reference
samples and fits the returned measurements.

## Status

Working today:

- Raw SocketCAN via `libc` — no wrapper crates, direct control over
  timeouts/filters for the realtime loop.
- Full wire protocol for both vendors, ported bit-for-bit from
  `almond_axol/motor/{myactuator,damiao}.py`:
  - MyActuator RMD (IDs 0x01-0x05, request `0x140+id` / reply `0x240+id`):
    version, model, multi-turn angle, status1/2 reads; MIT frame encode.
  - Damiao (IDs 0x06-0x08, register access on `0x7FF`, feedback on
    `0x10+id`): register read, feedback request (`0xCC`), feedback decode,
    MIT frame encode.
  - `mit_encode` is validated against a Python-driver reference vector in
    `cargo test`.
- `axol-rt scan` — read-only identity/state sweep of all 16 motors.
- `axol-rt bench` — paced full-bus telemetry loop (read-only), both buses
  in parallel threads.
- `axol-rt hold` — enable + MIT-hold the current pose + disable, gains and
  gravity feedforward from `tools/gen_hold_params.py`.
- `axol-rt serve` — the realtime core: owns both buses, paces a 240 Hz MIT
  stream, and plays impedance targets streamed from Python over a Unix
  socket. This is what `axol teleop` runs.
- `axol-rt proxy` — maintenance CAN plus a precisely paced tuning experiment
  engine and Rust-side rolling timing aggregation. Passive dashboard clients
  receive 30 Hz state frames and 10 Hz timing summaries while Rust observes
  every on-wire frame.
- `axol-rt jelly` — owns Jelly's four wheel motors: enable/disable, 50 Hz
  vector slew and x-drive mix, command watchdog, gyro heading hold, and the
  velocity/impedance park state machine.

Measured on the robot (2026-08-27):

| test | result |
|------|--------|
| bench 240 Hz telemetry | tick lateness p99 0.014 ms, 0/9600 replies lost |
| serve, teleop headless | 30000 ticks @ 240 Hz, 0.03% late, watchdog + disarm clean |
| serve, wrist_3 ±8° sinusoid + gripper cycle | worst tracking error 0.42° (moving), ≤0.11° (holding); gripper swept 1.00→0.66→1.00 as commanded |
| serve, Python killed while armed | core held 10 s, disabled everything, exited clean (historical — the core now exits with the motors holding; see Safety) |
| TX-stall detection (unpowered bus, e-stop condition) | 348 frames queued, ENOBUFS drops for 1 s, stall declared at 1.75 s (`cargo test stall_detection_live -- --ignored`) |

For comparison, the Python control loop under teleop measured 30-57% of
ticks late. 500 Hz full-bus telemetry is a *wire* limit, not a host limit:
8 request/reply pairs = 16 frames ≈ 2.1 ms at 1 Mbps, so the bus caps a
full round-robin at ~430 Hz. 240 Hz leaves ~45% bus headroom.

## The hybrid split (as built)

Python keeps the **slow model math**: `AxolArm.motion_control` still runs
joint limits, the max-step gate, MuJoCo gravity, and the pose *scheduling*
of the fast terms (pose-scaled damping gain and inertia gain, pose-tracked
band-pass centre). The teleop pipeline's target shaping — the pose
low-pass, the IK-output EMA, and the Python trapezoid with its engage
velocity ramp and output guard — also stays: those filters condition the
*target stream* and live with IK. A command sink hands
per-joint 9-float tuples `(p_des, mode, kp, kd, t_ff, kd_host, damp_w0,
damp_q, j_eff)` to `almond_axol.robot.Axol`, which ships them to this core
(~120 Hz) instead of sending CAN from Python. `t_ff` is gravity only in
tracked mode; `mode 0` (gravity comp) is a tracker-bypassing passthrough
with `v_des = 0`.

The core owns the wire and the **fast physics**, all per tick from its
own trajectory and feedback states:

- Hard 240 Hz pacing (spin-assisted `sleep_until`). On every partitioned
  host (4+ cores: Jetson and Raspberry Pi 5), the left and right CAN threads
  are pinned to dedicated CPUs, separate from Python control, IK, camera
  relay, and dataset recording, and run at SCHED_FIFO priority 20. The
  launcher (`rt.link`) sets both from `affinity.core_groups()`; the binary
  needs `CAP_SYS_NICE` (`axol rt.install` grants it) and refuses to arm
  without the real-time class rather than run the phase-sensitive damping
  on CFS timing.
- **In-core target tracker**: the golden-ported `TrapezoidalFilter`
  (`filter::Trapezoid`) chases the latest streamed target under the
  config velocity/acceleration limits (teleop caps × 1.5 headroom),
  replacing linear segment interpolation. Its position is the wire
  trajectory (the low-pass derivative below supplies wire velocity), and
  target-rate wobble is absorbed by the tracker's own dynamics.
- **In-core friction + inertia feedforwards**: the tanh friction model
  (per-joint params ride the config) and streamed pose-scaled `j_eff` use
  the classic Python 20 rad/s command-derivative chain, now driven by the
  executed tracker position. The low-pass velocity plus second low-pass
  acceleration derivative are important: the raw 240 Hz tracker
  acceleration reacts to each new 120 Hz target differently from the
  repeated-target tick, which previously produced an alternating inertia
  torque and felt vibration during motion.
- **In-core host damping**: band-passed `(v_des − v_meas)` scaled by the
  streamed pose-scheduled gain, computed every tick from the latest
  feedback, with `v_des` the fast low-pass derivative of tracker position.
  The counter-torque reaches the wire within one 240 Hz tick. The filter chain
  (`src/filter.rs`) is ported from `almond_axol.robot.control` and
  golden-tested against it. Damping is a phase race — computing the
  torque in Python put it ~14 ms behind the velocity it acts on (120 Hz
  sample + socket + interpolation), which pushed the shoulder burst band
  (4-9 Hz) past 90° of loop phase, where a damper *pumps* the mode: that
  was the violent rt-teleop shaking of 2026-08-27. In-core, the torque
  lands within one tick, and damping stays live through every core-owned
  hold (watchdog, orphaned client) — frozen-`t_ff` holds used to leave
  the shoulders ringing on firmware kd alone. `cargo test` includes a
  dissipated-power comparison of the two chains. The shared robot config
  gives shoulder-1 on both arms a Q=3 band: it keeps unity gain at the
  intended ~3.2 Hz mode while rejecting the measured 12.5-13.6 Hz
  mast/forearm structural mode. Every production flow consumes the same
  value, and explicit calibration or CLI Q values remain authoritative.
- **Faults never disable the motors.** Dropping the arms is worse than
  anything the checks detect. Torque comes off only on an explicit `D`
  disarm of a healthy session (the operator's deliberate stop) or an
  e-stop.
- **A loss-of-trust fault goes limp.** A motor silent for a second means
  the core should stop applying stiffness and phase-sensitive damping to a
  joint it cannot see — so it does exactly that: every arm joint on
  both buses drops to kp = 0, firmware kd only, with the streamed gravity
  `t_ff` still applied, and the loop keeps running. It reports `limp: ...`;
  Python's `motion_control` switches to streaming gravity comp (gravity at
  the measured pose), so the arms are weightless and hand-guidable. The
  operator moves them to rest and restarts. This is the classic
  contact-hold gravity comp, entered from the core side; limp is never
  cleared within a session and a disarm while limp leaves the motors limp.
- **Late ticks degrade, never limp.** Timing gets missed replies'
  degraded tier and nothing above it. A whole-cycle overrun (a tick that
  wakes a full period or more late), three late ticks (> 0.5 ms) in a
  row, or 8 of the last 32 late marks that *bus* timing-degraded: host
  damping off on every joint of the bus until a clean 32-tick window, and
  the overrun tick's tracker advances one nominal period with its
  derivative chains re-seeded at rest — the motors held the previous
  command across the gap, so there is no trajectory to differentiate and
  no inertia or damping torque to compute from it. Firmware kp/kd and the
  streamed gravity `t_ff` are untouched: the arm keeps holding. The
  transition is a `W` warning line carrying the thread's own counters
  across that wake (`src/stall.rs`: `/proc/thread-self/schedstat`
  runnable-wait, `getrusage(RUSAGE_THREAD)` page faults and involuntary
  switches, sampled every tick for ~2 µs) and what they read as —
  *preempted*, *page fault*, or *kernel stall* — so a field log names the
  subsystem to look at; further overruns inside a degraded stretch are
  logged the same way (rate-limited), and the five-second stats line
  counts overruns and degraded ticks/episodes. No amount of lateness is a
  loss of trust: a late tick invalidates exactly the terms degraded turns
  off, and the motors ride out a late host on their own firmware gains —
  the same thing they do if the host dies. (Before this, one overrun went
  straight to limp; the 2026-09-04 field record was a single 20–60 ms
  stall in an otherwise perfect ~770k-tick session, each time while the
  dataset writer flushed a save, and it cost a full stop/restart while the
  arms were holding still.)
- **Memory is locked.** `serve` calls `mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE)`
  before accepting its client, so a page reclaimed under the recorder's
  I/O pressure can never fault a `SCHED_FIFO` bus thread mid-tick; the
  per-tick reply bookkeeping is preallocated so the loop never grows the
  heap. A failed lock (no `CAP_IPC_LOCK`, low `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` on a dev
  build) is reported on stdout and as a `W` line and the core runs
  unlocked as it always did.
- **Hard faults leave the last command in place.** A dead bus (e-stop),
  bring-up failure, protocol error, signal, or lost client stops the
  stream and exits with each motor holding its last MIT command on
  firmware gains — what a classic Python session dying mid-command did.
- Watchdog: targets stop arriving → the tracker converges on the last
  target and the arms hold there, damping active (matching what the
  firmware itself does if a host dies mid-command, plus the damper).
  Client disconnect while armed → stop streaming and exit, motors holding.
- No position-deviation abort, matching the classic controller. Position
  error is not a safety signal on a compliant impedance controller: a hand
  on the arm and a joint that lost torque (overtemp self-disable) both look
  like "deviation", and the old 25° abort dropped healthy arms for both.
  Contact is the Python torque-residual `ContactWatchdog`'s job (limp
  gravity-comp hold, operator resets); a self-disabled motor just stops
  contributing while the rest of the arm keeps working.
- Max-step gate on incoming targets (corruption defense; Python's gate is
  the real per-command limit — and whatever gets through, the tracker's
  limits bound what the wire can see).
- Any protocol error (e.g. a version-skewed target size) stops the bus
  threads before the process exits, motors holding.
- TX-stall (e-stop) handling, ported from `motor/bus.py`: `ENOBUFS`
  persisting >1 s across sends means no node is ACKing — the e-stop cut
  motor power. The core stops commanding, purges the poisoned TX queue
  (bring-up script or `ip link` flap; direct when root, `sudo -n`
  otherwise) so up to `txqueuelen` stale MIT commands can't replay and
  snap the arm when power returns, and takes the session down as a clear
  fault — re-powered motors come back disabled and need a fresh bring-up
  anyway. Transient single-frame `ENOBUFS` (host-side congestion) just
  drops that frame, like the Python path.

The gripper rides the same target packets in slot 7 as a POSITION_FORCE
command (motor-frame target, speed limit, torque limit). It is exempt
from the max-step gate and feedback-health tracking (stalling against an
object is its job), is never commanded until the first target arrives,
and its bring-up — enable, open-stop calibration or attach/restore of a
holding jaw — stays in Python, run on the quiet bus before the core arms.

Measured feedback flows back to Python as telemetry: once per bus per
tick the core ships an `F` packet (per-slot position, velocity, torque,
and frame age) over the socket, and Python fills its `Motor` caches from
it — positions and torques stay fresh for `get_positions`, recording, and
the contact watchdog, with receive timestamps reconstructed to within
socket transit. The Rust maintenance proxy exits before the realtime core
arms, so Python has no CAN socket and the core is the only command/feedback
owner during control. Roughly 480 tiny telemetry packet decodes/s replace the
~7,700 frame/s dispatch load of the removed Python control path.

Bring-up is split so Python's calibration logic stays authoritative while
Rust owns every CAN syscall: the core resets the arm motors first (`prep`,
gripper untouched), then a Rust maintenance proxy carries offset/range reads
and gripper calibration frames, the proxy exits, and the realtime core enables
and holds (`arm`). The socket protocols live in `src/serve.rs` / `src/proxy.rs`
(Rust) and the Python link classes — length-prefixed messages with packed
targets or CAN frames.

Guarded return stays on the same core: `torque_residuals` and
`reset_command_state` are cache/state-only, and `gravity_compensate`
streams its tuples through the same command sink — the contact watchdog,
the limp contact hold, and the replanned reset all run against the core.

### Mink tracking profile

`Axol(tracking_profile="mink")` emits the strict optional config line
`tracking_profile mink`. The last received joint target goes directly to the
Rust trapezoid, each step uses measured tick spacing, and command
velocity/acceleration derivatives continue across overruns. Target holdover
and the default profile's overrun derivative re-seeding are disabled. Mink
supplies joint targets without a Python trapezoid ahead of this core.

Both profiles use the same target validation, watchdog, timing/feedback health
gates, and fault handling. Selecting Mink does not change configured joint
gains. Omitting the directive retains the default profile. A binary that does
not support the directive rejects it during configuration, before CAN
preparation; rebuild the core together with the Python package.

`cargo test mink_matches_reference_trace` checks all samples of an independent
reference trace, including 30 Hz joint targets, 240 Hz reset targets, cadence
transitions, target gaps, and core overruns. Regenerate it with
`python tools/gen_mink_trace.py` (CPU only; no CAN access). The generator
compiles the checked-in scalar equations in `tools/gen_mink_reference.rs`,
which are independent of the runtime filters and profile selection. It needs
only Python and `rustc`; no repository history or external checkout is needed.

### Control-term tracing

`axol teleop --teleop.record NAME` automatically gates this trace to the
latest engaged segment and compacts both arms into `NAME_rt.npz` on teardown.
`axol collect-data` always assigns a unique prefix when none was supplied and
records tracking plus guarded-reset motion after PyRoKi is ready, so a
collection-only timing or damping fault is preserved automatically.
For low-level runs outside teleop, set `AXOL_RT_TRACE` to a path prefix to
capture one raw CSV per arm without doing file I/O on the realtime threads:

```bash
AXOL_RT_TRACE=/tmp/axol-run axol teleop
# writes /tmp/axol-run-left.csv and /tmp/axol-run-right.csv
```

Each 240 Hz joint row includes the streamed target, wire position/velocity,
measured position/velocity/torque, filter states, and separate gravity,
friction, inertia, and host-damping torque contributions. The bus threads
enqueue fixed-size rows into bounded channels; background threads format and
write them, and the regular five-second status line reports any trace drops.

## Safety

`scan` and `bench` are strictly read-only — safe against a powered robot
at rest. `hold` requires `--yes` to actuate. `serve` only actuates after
the explicit config/prep/arm handshake. Only a deliberate disarm of a
healthy session disables the motors (a disabled arm falls). A silent
motor takes the session limp — gravity comp
on every joint, still serving, so the operator can hand-guide the arms to
rest; a dead bus, signal, or client loss stops the stream and leaves the
arms holding their last command. Missed CAN replies and late ticks
degrade rather than fault: host damping is never computed from a stale
sample or across a lost tick, a joint missing 4 of the last 32 replies (or
a bus with a whole-cycle overrun / 8 of 32 late ticks) runs on firmware kd
(logged with the stall's attribution, counted in the five-second stats
line) until a clean window, and only a motor silent for a full second
takes the session limp — bursty loss is expected while cameras and IK
compilation contend for the same host and USB fabric during startup, and
an isolated stall while the dataset writer flushes is not a reason to end
a session whose arms were holding still. `proxy` is the sole
frame transport for maintenance, tuning, firmware, and arm diagnostics;
`jelly` owns Jelly's wheel bus, while the proxy carries its lift bus. Both use
the realtime core's persistent-TX-stall detection and queue purge, aborting
instead of allowing stale motion frames to replay after an e-stop.

## Build / run

`axol provision` (or `axol rt.install` standalone) builds and installs the
binary automatically — rustup toolchain included, and on uv-tool installs
(no repo checkout) it fetches these sources at the installed package's exact
ref. The binary goes into `UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR` when set (the hosted installer
uses `/usr/local/bin`) or `~/.local/bin` otherwise. Manual path:

```sh
cargo build --release           # needs no cross-compile: built on the Jetson
./target/release/axol-rt scan   # identity + state of every motor
./target/release/axol-rt bench --hz 240 --secs 5
uv run python tools/gen_hold_params.py /tmp/hold.txt
./target/release/axol-rt hold --params /tmp/hold.txt --secs 5 --yes
uv run python tools/rt_smoke.py --secs 8   # end-to-end serve smoke test
uv run axol teleop                         # the real thing
```

Default interfaces are `can_alm_axol_l` and `can_alm_axol_r`; pass others
as positional args (`scan` / `bench`). The teleop path finds the binary
via `AXOL_RT_BIN`, `PATH`, or this crate's `target/release/`.

The binary and the Python package must come from the same checkout: every
config opens with a `proto <n>` line (`CONFIG_PROTO` in `serve.rs`,
`almond_axol.rt.link.CONFIG_PROTO`) and a core that speaks a different
generation refuses it and exits, which Python reports as a stale-binary
error. After pulling changes to this crate in a dev checkout, rebuild
(`cargo build --release` here, or `axol rt.install`) before running
anything against hardware.

## Roadmap

Nothing pending — the split described above is fully built: Rust owns the
wire in both directions for production control and every maintenance/tuning
utility. Python is orchestration, model math, fitting, and UI only.
