//! The realtime core: own the CAN buses and run the control loop, driven by
//! impedance targets streamed from Python over a Unix socket.
//!
//! Python keeps the slow model math — VR, IK, target shaping, MuJoCo
//! gravity/inertia, and the pose *scheduling* of the fast terms (all of
//! `AxolArm.motion_control`) — and ships per-joint tuples at its own rate
//! (~120 Hz). This loop owns the wire and the *fast* physics, all computed
//! per tick from its own trajectory and feedback states:
//!
//! - a velocity/acceleration-limited tracker (`filter::Trapezoid`, the
//!   golden-ported `TrapezoidalFilter`) chases the latest streamed target
//!   at `loop_hz`, replacing linear segment interpolation — its position
//!   renders the wire trajectory;
//! - friction (`filter::friction`, per-joint params from the config) and
//!   inertia (`j_eff` streamed pose-scaled per target) feedforwards from
//!   low-pass derivatives of that trajectory. This preserves the classic
//!   Python command chain and prevents the 120 Hz target staircase from
//!   becoming an alternating 240 Hz acceleration torque;
//! - the host-damping torque — band-passed velocity damping from the latest
//!   feedback, using the pose-scheduled coefficients streamed with each
//!   target and reaching the wire within one core tick;
//! - a late target is carried forward along the stream's own velocity
//!   (`filter::Holdover`, ≤ 80 ms, gliding to rest) so a Python tick that
//!   lost the CPU renders as smooth motion instead of a stop-then-lunge —
//!   smoothness is not left to the host's scheduler;
//! - and the last target is held (tracker converges and stays, damping
//!   live) when targets stop arriving.
//!
//! On robot-sized hosts the launcher reserves two CPUs for CAN and exports
//! one assignment per side. Each bus thread pins itself before opening its
//! interface and requests SCHED_FIFO priority when permitted, keeping camera,
//! IK, and dataset load from stretching the damping loop's phase delay.
//!
//! Targets carry a mode flag: gravity-comp / hold flows stream
//! *passthrough* targets (`mode 0`) that bypass the tracker and the
//! friction/inertia terms — a hand-guided limp arm needs `v_des = 0` and
//! model gravity only.
//!
//! Damping lives here, not in Python, because damping is a phase race: the
//! remote chain (Python's 120 Hz sample → socket → adoption wait → a
//! stretched interpolation segment) added ~14 ms between measuring a
//! velocity and the counter-torque reaching the wire. On top of the loop's
//! intrinsic lags that pushed the shoulder burst band (4-9 Hz) past 90° —
//! where a damper stops damping and *pumps* the mode. That was measured on
//! hardware as violent shaking in rt teleop (2026-08-27; see the
//! dissipated-power test in `filter.rs`). In-core the torque applies within
//! one 240 Hz tick of the feedback it acts on. It also keeps damping active
//! through every core-owned hold (watchdog starvation, orphaned client) —
//! frozen-`t_ff` holds used to leave the shoulders with firmware kd only,
//! which is a 62%-overshoot ring at their tuned kp.
//!
//! ## Protocol (length-prefixed messages: u32 LE size, then payload)
//!
//! Python -> Rust:
//! - `C` + text        config: a mandatory `proto <n>` line (must equal
//!                     `CONFIG_PROTO` — the client and this binary must
//!                     agree on the slot layout below, and a stale build
//!                     of either fails here, loudly, instead of silently
//!                     rejecting every target), `loop_hz`/`watchdog_ms`/
//!                     `max_step_rad` keys, one `joint <side> <iface> <name>
//!                     <motor_id> <kp> <kd> <max_vel> <max_accel> <fc> <k>
//!                     <fv> <fo>` line per arm joint (tracker limits +
//!                     friction params; the motor id 1..=7 fixes the
//!                     joint's target slot, so a bus may carry any subset
//!                     of the arm), and an optional `gripper <side>
//!                     <iface> <motor_id>` line
//! - `P`               prep: MyActuator 0x76 reset + settle, Damiao
//!                     clear-errors on every *cold* arm joint (torque-neutral
//!                     on a disabled motor; run *before* Python resolves
//!                     joint offsets, so the wrap state it verifies is the
//!                     post-reset one). Joints found already enabled and
//!                     holding are skipped — the reset would reboot them and
//!                     drop the arm — and named in an `L` line; the gripper
//!                     is never touched
//! - `A`               arm: bring-up, enable the cold joints, hold current
//!                     pose (holding joints are attached to without a brake
//!                     release / enable frame; the gripper must already be
//!                     enabled + calibrated in POSITION_FORCE mode by the
//!                     Python side)
//! - `T` + binary      target: side u8, seq u32 LE, 8 x 9 f64 LE — slots
//!                     0-6 are arm-joint tuples (p_des, mode, kp, kd,
//!                     t_ff, kd_host, damp_w0, damp_q, j_eff) where mode
//!                     ≥ 0.5 runs the tracker + friction/inertia terms
//!                     (teleop) and mode 0 is passthrough (gravity comp);
//!                     t_ff carries the *slow* model feedforward (gravity
//!                     only in tracked mode — friction/inertia/damping are
//!                     computed in-core), kd_host/damp_w0/damp_q are the
//!                     pose-scheduled damping coefficients, and j_eff is
//!                     the pose-scaled inertia feedforward gain (Nm·s²/rad);
//!                     slot 7 is the gripper (p_des motor-frame, max_speed
//!                     rad/s, max_torque Nm, then six zeros)
//! - `R` + binary      flight-recorder gate: enabled u8 and, on enable, the
//!                     Python monotonic timestamp f64 LE. A rising edge
//!                     truncates the previous segment and starts a gated
//!                     `AXOL_RT_TRACE`; disable stops adding rows.
//! - `D`               disarm: disable motors, threads exit. The *only*
//!                     path that ever disables the motors (and only when no
//!                     fault is latched); see Safety.
//!
//! Rust -> Python:
//! - `S` + text        state message. `fault: ...` — the core stopped
//!                     streaming (bus dead / arm failed); `limp: ...` — the
//!                     core is still serving but at kp = 0 with the streamed
//!                     gravity t_ff on every arm joint (see Safety); the
//!                     client should keep streaming gravity-comp targets.
//! - `L` + text        log line
//! - `W` + text        warning line: a degraded transition worth the
//!                     operator's attention (the client logs it at WARNING)
//! - `F` + binary      telemetry, one per bus per tick while armed: side
//!                     u8, valid-mask u8, then 8 x (pos f64, vel f64, tau
//!                     f64, age_us u32) — the latest decoded feedback per
//!                     slot. Python fills its Motor caches from these (see
//!                     `build_feedback`); it does not read CAN while the
//!                     core is armed.
//!
//! ## Safety
//! - **A fault never disables the motors.** Cutting torque drops the arms,
//!   which is worse than any condition the checks detect. Torque comes off
//!   only on an explicit `D` disarm of a healthy session (or an e-stop,
//!   which removes motor power itself).
//! - **A loss-of-trust fault goes *limp*, not dead.** A motor silent for a
//!   second means the core should no longer be applying stiffness or
//!   phase-sensitive damping to a joint it cannot see — so it stops doing
//!   exactly that and nothing more: every arm joint on both buses goes to
//!   kp = 0, firmware kd `LIMP_KD`, no host damping or inertia term, with
//!   the streamed gravity `t_ff` still applied (Python keeps evaluating it
//!   at the measured pose). The loop keeps running, so the arms are
//!   weightless and hand-guidable — the operator moves them to rest and
//!   restarts. This is the classic contact-hold gravity comp, entered from
//!   the core side. Limp is enforced in-core regardless of what targets
//!   arrive, and is never cleared within a session. A disarm while limp
//!   leaves the motors limp rather than disabling.
//! - **Hard faults stop the stream and leave the last command in place.**
//!   A dead bus (TX stall — the e-stop cut motor power), a bring-up
//!   failure, a protocol error, a signal, or a lost client: the core
//!   reports `fault: ...` (where it can), stops streaming, and exits with
//!   each motor holding its last MIT command on firmware gains — the same
//!   outcome as a classic Python session dying mid-command.
//! - Targets stepping more than `max_step_rad` from the previous target
//!   are rejected (counted, and warned about at most every
//!   `DEGRADED_LOG_INTERVAL` naming the joint and step, since a rejected
//!   stream leaves the arm parked while the client believes it is moving)
//!   — corruption defense; the Python side has its own max-step gate. The
//!   gripper slot is exempt (its targets legitimately jump, matching the
//!   Python gate). Whatever gets through, the tracker's
//!   velocity/acceleration limits bound what the wire can ever see.
//! - There is deliberately **no position-deviation abort**, matching the
//!   classic Python controller. Position error on a compliant impedance
//!   controller is not a safety signal: a hand on the arm and a joint that
//!   lost torque (overtemp self-disable) both look like "deviation", and
//!   the old 25° abort took down healthy arms for both. Contact is handled
//!   by the Python torque-residual `ContactWatchdog` (limp gravity-comp
//!   hold, operator resets); a self-disabled motor just stops contributing
//!   while the rest of the arm keeps working, as in classic mode.
//! - Every command batch accepts exactly one fresh reply per motor. A missed
//!   sample suppresses host damping for that tick; bursty loss (4 of the last
//!   32 ticks) marks the joint *degraded* — host damping stays off until a
//!   clean 32-tick window, the transition is logged, and the loop keeps
//!   running on firmware kd. Only a motor silent for a full second takes
//!   the session limp.
//! - **Late ticks degrade, never limp.** Timing gets feedback's degraded
//!   tier and nothing above it. A whole-cycle overrun (a wake a full
//!   period or more late), three late ticks in a row, or 8 of the last 32
//!   late marks the *bus* timing-degraded: host damping off on every joint
//!   of that bus until a clean 32-tick window, and the overrun tick's
//!   tracker advances one nominal period with its derivative chains
//!   re-seeded at rest — the motors held the previous command across the
//!   gap, so there is no trajectory to differentiate. Firmware kp/kd and
//!   the streamed gravity `t_ff` are untouched, so the arm keeps holding —
//!   a late host is what the firmware is built to ride out, which is why
//!   no amount of lateness is a loss of trust. The transition (and each
//!   further overrun inside a degraded stretch, rate-limited) is logged as
//!   a warning with the thread's own scheduler/memory counters across that
//!   wake (`stall.rs`: runnable-wait, page faults, involuntary switches) so
//!   the line says whether the loop was preempted, faulting, or blocked in
//!   the kernel.
//! - The process locks its memory (`mlockall`, `stall::lock_memory`) before
//!   accepting a client, so a page reclaimed under the dataset writer's I/O
//!   pressure can never fault a bus thread mid-tick. A failed lock (no
//!   `CAP_IPC_LOCK`, low `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` on a dev build) is logged and
//!   the core runs unlocked as it always did.
//! - The gripper is not commanded at all until the first target arrives
//!   (matching classic mode, where it sits idle until motion_control).
//! - Watchdog: no target for `watchdog_ms` holds the last target (the
//!   holdover has glided to rest well before then; the tracker converges
//!   and stays, damping live). The arms keep holding —
//!   matching what the firmware itself does if the host dies — until a
//!   disarm or an operator e-stop.
//! - Client disconnect while armed, SIGINT/SIGTERM, and protocol errors
//!   stop the stream and exit with the motors holding (not disabled).
