axol collect-dagger

DAgger data collection: run a trained policy on the Axol robot while the
operator watches in VR and can intervene to guide it, and record the whole
thing (policy segments + human corrections) as training data.

``policy_type=custom`` selects the custom policy interface (v2) with nonblocking
inference, optional continuous shadow inference during interventions, and
held-grip controls. Either grip takes over that arm; the other holds. Both
released requests a fresh policy plan, holding the final operator command
until it arrives and blending after IK. No model-specific logic lives here.
The following freeze/toggle description applies to the local-policy mode.

The VR grip ("side") buttons drive the intervention flow during an episode:

    POLICY  --(either grip alone)-->  FROZEN   robot holds pose; capture PAUSED
    FROZEN  --(both grips)------->    TELEOP   operator drives;  capture RESUMES
    TELEOP  --(either grip alone)-->  POLICY   policy continues; capture keeps running

Nothing is recorded between the freeze and the takeover, so the dataset flows
seamlessly from the policy's motion into the correction (LeRobot frame
timestamps are index-based; the capture thread re-anchors its clock on resume).
On takeover the IK worker and smoothing filters are synced to the robot's
*measured* pose first (see :mod:`almond_axol.teleop.dagger`), so engaging never
drags the arm toward a stale target; the grippers adopt the controller
triggers immediately — pre-set them before engaging (hold the trigger down
so a held part stays gripped). When the operator hands back, the policy
backend is reset so it re-plans from the corrected pose instead of continuing
from its pre-freeze state, and the policy velocity envelope is re-anchored at
the corrected pose.

Episode boundaries are driven from VR exactly like ``collect-data``: press
record to start an episode (the policy starts driving and recording begins),
press it again to end and save it, or press it with the reset button held to
discard and re-record. ``s`` / ``r`` / ``q`` on stdin mirror the same choices
for an assistant at the terminal, the ``--episode_time_s`` safety cap saves
the episode, and typing a subtask number switches the policy's instruction
mid-episode when ``--subtasks`` is supplied. Between episodes the
collision-aware ``IKResetController`` homes the arms, and the grips work as
plain teleop (engage with both, release with one — nothing is recorded) so
the operator can reset the scene with the arms, mirroring ``collect-data``'s
pre-record phase; the VR reset button homes the arms on demand, and they
re-home when record is pressed if teleop left them away from rest, so the
policy always starts from the rest pose. Every one of those rest moves is
*guarded*: a torque-residual contact watchdog (the shared teleop-config knobs
``--teleop_config.vr_teleop_config.reset_torque_threshold`` /
``.reset_gravity_comp_kd``) stops the move on unexpected contact and drops
the arms into a limp gravity-comp hold; the VR reset button (idle-phase
homes) or the continue gate (terminal Enter / panel button) retries from
wherever the arms were hand-guided to.

Inference runs in-process, one policy call per control tick (the same
pre/post-processor + ``select_action`` pipeline as LeRobot's sync rollout
engine). Interventions are annotated the way LeRobot's own DAgger rollout
strategy annotates them: the dataset declares a per-frame bool
``intervention`` feature and every row recorded while the operator was
driving is tagged ``True`` (rows from the policy are ``False``). On top of
that, every intervention span is tracked in *dataset* time (recorded
frames / fps — the episode's own timeline, so spans stay inside the episode
boundaries despite the unrecorded frozen gaps); a package building on this
command can persist them in other formats (see :class:`_DaggerControlLoop`).
The policy backend itself is pluggable (:class:`DaggerPolicy`), so a
downstream package can drive the same session loop with a remotely-hosted
policy.

Camera and recording plumbing follows ``collect-data``'s proven
out-of-process split, with one twist this flow needs: the video relay owns
the ZED cameras and streams the headset view, and beside its relay-encoded
dataset branch (which the ``DatasetRecorderProcess`` subprocess muxes, as in
``collect-data``) it publishes the same exposures into a shared-memory ring
readable by *this* process — the policy builds its observations from it
(``raw_transport: "gstshm+pyshm"``; without gst's shm plugin both fall back
to one pyshm ring, and the recorder re-encodes). The frozen gap uses the
recorder's ``pause_episode``/``resume_episode`` gate (the encoded loop
discards the gap's AUs and re-aligns row zero on resume; the raw loop
re-anchors its clock — either way episodes play straight through). Nothing
camera- or encode-related runs in the control process, which is what keeps
the policy at fps and teleop at ``--teleop_hz``. The relay is required —
there is no in-process fallback (per-frame camera Python in the control
process starves the control loops and the CAN bus).

      dict, through the velocity envelope.
    - TELEOP: ``teleop.get_action()`` (the smoothed IK output, seeded at the
      robot's pose on takeover).
    - FROZEN: re-send the last commanded action so the robot holds pose and
      command replies keep the joint cache fresh.

    Every tick publishes the ``(joint_obs, action)`` snapshot to the recorder
    subprocess (a small shared-memory write), which pairs it with the relay's
    camera frames on its configured recording clock. Policy snapshots carry the
    median exposure timestamp of the images that produced the action; TELEOP
    snapshots carry their live control-tick time. The TELEOP state publishes with
    ``intervention=True``, which is how the recorder tags the dataset's
    per-frame ``intervention`` feature (LeRobot's native DAgger annotation).
    The frozen gap is gated in the recorder
    (``pause_episode``/``resume_episode``), and the intervention
    span times come from its row counts — dataset time = rows / fps, the
    episode's own timeline. The FROZEN state still publishes the held action
    so the recorder's snapshot always matches the live command when capture
    resumes.

    Surfaces unhandled exceptions via :attr:`fatal_error` so the episode
    supervisor can tear down cleanly.
