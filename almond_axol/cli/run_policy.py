axol run-policy

Run a trained policy on the Axol robot with its local ZED cameras using
LeRobot's async inference (``lerobot.async_inference``). By default a
``PolicyServer`` is auto-launched in a child process on localhost; pass
``--server_host`` to use a remote inference server started with
``axol inference-server`` on a more powerful machine instead (joint
positions + camera frames are streamed to it over gRPC and it returns
action chunks). Either way the parent drives an ``AxolRobotClient`` (a
thin ``RobotClient`` subclass) that streams observations to the server
and consumes the returned action chunks. Cameras and joints are sampled
via ``ZedCamera.read_at_or_after(now)`` so every inference observation is
timestamp-aligned the same way the training data is (see
``AxolRobot.get_observation``).

Each episode runs until the operator types ``s`` (save), ``r`` (rerecord
+ discard), or ``q`` (quit + discard) on stdin. ``--episode_time_s`` is a
safety cap that falls back to the same ``[Enter]=save / r / q`` prompt
when no key has been pressed.

    ``--robot_config.cameras.<slot>.serial`` override (or control-panel field),
    but only the slots you assign a serial to are used — the rest are pruned by
    ``AxolRobotConfig.select_assigned_cameras`` (at least one must be assigned;
    assign the cameras the policy was trained on). draccus takes dict fields as
    one inline YAML/JSON value, so assign serials with e.g.
    ``--robot_config.cameras "{overhead: {serial: 41234567}}"``. Other fields
    are overridable too, e.g. ``--robot_config.axol_config.left_stiffness 0.8``
    (match the stiffness used at data-collection time).

    Inference captures through the ZED Python SDK (``video_backend="sdk"``):
    run-policy streams no headset video, so the GPU-resident gst pipeline's
    encoded branch would be pure waste here. Teleop and collect-data default
    to the gst path; pass ``--robot_config.video_backend gst`` to opt in.

    ``telemetry_hz=0``: the background telemetry pollers (16 motors at the
    default demand rate is on the order of 2k CAN transactions/s) contend on
    the same robot event loop every action send must transit, and measurably
    drag the achieved control rate far below the configured fps. During an
    episode the control loop issues ``motion_control`` on every tick that
    has an action queued, and those feedback frames keep the position cache
    fresh (the ``telemetry_hz=0`` contract in config_axol.py, same as
    collect-data); on queue-dry ticks and between episodes no command goes
    out, but an uncommanded arm holds position — the cache is stale but
    static. Override with ``--robot_config.telemetry_hz`` if a session

        Diverges from upstream in three places:

        - ``_aggregate_action_queues`` dispatches to a vectorized
          ``temporal_ensemble`` (ACT smoothing) when selected, otherwise
          falls through to the scalar blends. The final queue swap goes
          through ``_install_future_queue`` to avoid re-popping a
          just-executed timestep.
        - ``control_loop`` only pops actions; observation capture + send
          moves to ``observation_loop`` so the ~60-70 ms ZED read + gRPC
          send can't stall the 60 Hz action stream.
        - ``control_loop_action`` updates ``latest_action`` atomically
          with the queue pop (upstream updates it after ``send_action``,
          which leaves a re-pop race for the aggregator).

        Everything here is built on public ``RobotClient`` API (public
        instance attributes + public ``control_loop_observation`` /
        ``send_action`` / ``actions_available``) with one unavoidable
        exception: overriding ``_aggregate_action_queues``. LeRobot calls
        the aggregator by that private name inside the public
        ``receive_actions`` (robot_client.py), and its only public
        aggregation hook (``RobotClientConfig.aggregate_fn_name``) selects
        one of four *stateless, pairwise* blend functions — which cannot
        express our stateful, multi-chunk, recency-weighted
        ``temporal_ensemble``. Overriding the private method is therefore
        the minimal seam. ``__init__`` asserts the symbol still exists so a
        LeRobot bump that renames it fails loudly instead of silently
        disabling ensembling. (Upstreaming a public aggregator hook would
        remove this last dependency.)

        The constructor also skips ``make_robot_from_config`` / connect so
        re-recording doesn't pay the camera reconnect cost, publishes
        executed actions to ``ActionPublisher``, and ``stop()`` tears
        down only the gRPC channel (the robot is shared across episodes).
        No post-filter is applied: training actions are already

            late wakeups are corrected on the next cycle instead of
            stretching the command interval. Falling behind is handled in
            three tiers:

            - under one tick: absorbed by the deadline schedule;
            - up to ``MAX_CATCHUP_TICKS``: the overdue actions are *skipped*
              (see ``_skip_stale_actions``) and the schedule resynced — a
              transient degrades to a small, bounded hop forward on the
              planned trajectory, never to slow-motion replay. Skips are
              counted per episode and reported in the episode stats line; a
              healthy loop skips ~0;
            - beyond that in one event, or past
              ``EPISODE_SKIP_FAULT_BUDGET`` cumulative skips: the loop
              cannot hold the configured fps. Raised as a fault into the
              supervising thread (``fatal_error``, same path as a CAN
              error) so the episode tears down and the robot holds,
              instead of executing a degraded plan.

            Starvation never faults: lag that accrued while the queue was
            empty (server still computing the next chunk) is not lateness —
            there was nothing to be late *for* — so it only re-anchors the
            deadline. Attribution uses the PREVIOUS tick's availability, not
            just the wake-time queue state: a fresh chunk landing mid-stall
