axol run-policy

Run a trained policy on the Axol robot with its local ZED cameras using
LeRobot's async inference (``lerobot.async_inference``). By default a
``PolicyServer`` is auto-launched in a child process on localhost; pass
``--server_host`` to use a remote inference server started with
``axol inference-server`` on a more powerful machine instead (joint
positions + camera frames are streamed to it over gRPC and it returns
action chunks). ``--policy_type custom`` instead connects to your own
model's server (``almond_axol.policy.serve``) over a small WebSocket
protocol — no LeRobot checkpoint involved. Either way the parent drives an
``AxolRobotClient`` (a thin ``RobotClient`` subclass) that streams
observations to the server and consumes the returned action chunks. Cameras
and joints are sampled
via ``ZedCamera.read_at_or_after(now)`` so every inference observation is
timestamp-aligned the same way the training data is (see
``AxolRobot.get_observation``).

Each episode runs until the operator types ``s`` (save), ``r`` (rerecord
+ discard), or ``q`` (quit + discard) on stdin. ``--episode_time_s`` is a
safety cap that falls back to the same ``[Enter]=save / r / q`` prompt
when no key has been pressed.

        """``RobotClient`` adapted to reuse a pre-connected ``AxolRobot``.

        Diverges from upstream in three places:

        - ``_aggregate_action_queues`` dispatches to a vectorized
          ``temporal_ensemble`` (ACT smoothing) when selected, otherwise
          falls through to the scalar blends. The final queue swap goes
          through ``_install_future_queue`` to avoid re-popping a
          just-executed timestep.
        - ``control_loop`` only pops actions; observation capture + send
          moves to ``observation_loop`` so the ~60-70 ms ZED read + gRPC
          send can't stall the 60 Hz action stream.
        - ``control_loop_action`` updates ``latest_action`` atomically
          with the queue pop (upstream updates it after ``send_action``,
          which leaves a re-pop race for the aggregator).

        Everything here is built on public ``RobotClient`` API (public
        instance attributes + public ``control_loop_observation`` /
        ``send_action`` / ``actions_available``) with one unavoidable
        exception: overriding ``_aggregate_action_queues``. LeRobot calls
        the aggregator by that private name inside the public
        ``receive_actions`` (robot_client.py), and its only public
        aggregation hook (``RobotClientConfig.aggregate_fn_name``) selects
        one of four *stateless, pairwise* blend functions — which cannot
        express our stateful, multi-chunk, recency-weighted
        ``temporal_ensemble``. Overriding the private method is therefore
        the minimal seam. ``__init__`` asserts the symbol still exists so a
        LeRobot bump that renames it fails loudly instead of silently
        disabling ensembling. (Upstreaming a public aggregator hook would
        remove this last dependency.)

        The constructor also skips ``make_robot_from_config`` / connect so
        re-recording doesn't pay the camera reconnect cost, publishes
        executed actions to ``ActionPublisher``, and ``stop()`` tears
        down only the gRPC channel (the robot is shared across episodes).
        No per-step post-filter is applied (training actions are already
        EMA + trapezoidal-filtered in ``collect_data``); the only smoothing
        added on top of the ensemble is chunk-boundary continuity: the
        execution-side ``TrapezoidalFilter`` (same class and constants as
        teleop, i.e. the exact command profile the training data went
        through) shapes every command sent to the arms, and the horizon
        fade in ``_temporal_ensemble_aggregate`` removes chunk-expiry
        steps in the ensembled signal itself.

            A chunk is predicted from an observation taken one inference
            round-trip before it lands, of an arm that physically lags its
            command — so at arrival it systematically disagrees with the
            trajectory being executed by roughly the tracking error, and
            installing it unmodified yanks the target backward by that offset
            (a 5-6 Hz sawtooth measured on the CAN bus; with the execution
            filter it survives as a bounded-acceleration wobble the arm still
            tracks). Cancel the disagreement at the source: measure the
            chunk's instantaneous offset from the executing trajectory at the
            next-to-execute timestep once, at arrival, and add it to the
            chunk's values in place — faded out linearly over
            ``_align_ticks`` so the command still converges to the policy's
            absolute intent. Corrections live in the chunk's *shape* and pass
            through unfaded; only the stale-state DC disagreement is
            smoothed. The offset magnitude scales with inference latency, so
            a slow platform cancels a proportionally bigger step — smoothness
            stays independent of the inference hardware.
