"""Shared VR-teleoperation state machine (engage + smoothing + reset).

:class:`VRTeleopCore` is the single source of truth for the per-step control
logic that *both* teleop flows drive:

  - native :class:`almond_axol.teleop.teleop.VRTeleop` (``axol teleop``), and
  - the LeRobot adapter
    :class:`almond_axol.lerobot.teleop.teleop_vr.AxolVRTeleop` (``axol
    collect-data`` / ``run-policy``).

The two classes differ only in *transport* — native returns ``(left, right)``
joint tuples, the LeRobot adapter returns a ``RobotAction`` dict — and in how
they own the VR server, robot link, and IK subprocess. The engage toggle, the
EMA + trapezoidal smoothing (with gripper bypass), the post-engage velocity
restore, and the reset / startup-trajectory handling all live here so the two
flows cannot drift apart.

Threading contract (identical for both adapters):
  - The IK-dispatch thread calls :meth:`run_ik_loop`, which advances the engage
    state, dispatches resets, and publishes raw IK targets (:meth:`set_target`).
  - The control-loop thread calls :meth:`compute_output` once per step — the
    *only* place the smoothing filters are advanced, so it must run at the
    steady control rate, not the slower/jittery IK rate.
The few cross-thread float writes (``max_vel`` / ``engage_time`` set on the IK
thread and read on the control loop; ``reset_interp`` touched by both; the
pose heartbeat ``_last_frame_time`` set on the VR thread and read on the IK
thread) are single-word and benign — this matches the original design of both
adapters.

        (``is_resetting``); returns once the arms are home or the flow
        stopped. The move plays at the normal session gains — accurate
        tracking of the collision-checked path — and a torque residual

        path, including ones that never deliver the Y-press reset frame
        (system menu, headset doffed, app crash, WiFi drop).

        Staying engaged across the gap is what makes the arms jerk on the

        That freeze is deliberately where it ends: the arms *hold position*
        until an operator acts. A lost link, a quit app, or a crashed headset
        must never move the robot on its own — the operator reconnects and
        either re-engages (tracking resumes from where the arms are) or
