@dataclass
class VRTeleopConfig:
    """Configuration for a :class:`VRTeleop` session.

    Attributes:
        rest_pose_left: Left arm rest configuration in radians, shape (7,) in
            ARM_JOINTS order (no gripper). Used as the reset target.
        rest_pose_right: Right arm rest configuration in radians, shape (7,) in
            ARM_JOINTS order (no gripper). Used as the reset target.
        frequency: Control (CAN command) loop rate in Hz used by
            :meth:`VRTeleop.run` and as waypoint density for reset
            trajectories. Each cycle sends 8 impedance/position commands per
            arm bus whose replies carry all feedback — ~16 frames ≈ 2.1 ms
            of bus time — so 120 Hz runs each 1 Mbps arm bus at ~25%
            utilisation. A higher rate mainly buys the host damping loop
            phase margin (its transport delay is one cycle).
        ik_frequency: IK dispatch rate in Hz — how often VR frames are sent
            to the IK subprocess. Decoupled from ``frequency``: solves cost
            5-10 ms, so the solver can't follow the CAN rate; the control
            loop interpolates between solutions (segment playback + the
            trapezoidal output filter).
        reset_speed: Average joint velocity (rad/s) of the worst-case joint
            during a return-to-rest move. JAX smoothstep peaks at
            ``1.5 * reset_speed``; Mink's quintic timing and joint cap use
            ``1.875 * reset_speed``. Determines the
            number of trajectory waypoints based on the distance to the
            rest pose, subject to ``reset_min_duration`` below.
        reset_min_duration: Floor (seconds) on the return-to-rest trajectory
            duration. Prevents near-rest starts from snapping home in a
            handful of frames and gives every reset a consistent minimum
            feel regardless of starting pose. Defaults to ``1.5`` s.
        reset_rest_weight: JAX-only cost weight penalising deviation from the reset
            target pose during collision-aware trajectory generation.
        reset_limit_weight: JAX-only cost weight penalising joint-limit violations
            during reset trajectory generation.
        reset_collision_margin: JAX-only clearance activation margin (m)
            for the reset self-collision soft cost.
        mink_reset_collision_margin: Mink reset hard clearance (m), capped
            per pair by known home clearance minus 2 mm. Starts inside this
            buffer must recover monotonically. Defaults to 0.01 m. Shoulder
            mounts are excluded; no environment-object model is included.
        reset_collision_weight: JAX-only cost weight on self-collision penalty during
            reset trajectory generation.
        reset_max_iterations: JAX-only maximum solver iterations per reset waypoint.
        reset_torque_threshold: Contact watchdog for guarded return-to-rest
            moves (hardware only). If any arm joint's torque residual
            (measured minus modeled gravity, in the motor's torque units —
            Nm on Damiao) stays above this for a sustained window, the move
            is judged to have hit something — a gripper still hooked on the
            scene, or an operator grabbing an arm — and the arms drop into
            a limp gravity-comp hold until reset is pressed again, which
            replans from wherever the arms were left. Raise if normal
            returns false-trip on the friction / model-error background;
            ``0`` disables the watchdog. Defaults to ``4.0``.
        teleop_torque_threshold: Contact watchdog for the *tracking* phase
            (hardware only) — the same sustained-torque-residual trip as
            ``reset_torque_threshold``, but active while the operator is
            driving the arms (``axol teleop`` and ``collect-data``; replay
            playback shares this field). On a trip, tracking disengages and
            the arms drop into the limp gravity-comp hold; hand-guide them
            clear and press reset to return to rest and continue. ``0``
            (the default) disables it — tracking pushes against payloads
            and the scene on purpose, so only the return-to-rest guard is
            always on. Set a threshold (``16.0`` is the control panel's
            suggested value) to enable.
        reset_gravity_comp_kd: Velocity damping (Nm·s/rad) for the arm
            joints during the contact-fallback gravity-comp hold; same
            semantics as ``axol gravity-comp --kd``. Defaults to ``0.25``.
        hold_to_engage: Grip behaviour. ``False`` (default) is the toggle
            scheme: from rest, click both grips together to engage both
            arms; while engaged, a click on either grip toggles *that* arm
            between tracking and frozen (a frozen arm holds its pose and
            gripper — e.g. it keeps a grasp steady while the other arm
            works). ``True`` is the dead-man scheme: hold both grips to
            engage from rest, and each arm tracks only while its grip
            stays held — release a grip and that arm freezes where it is,
            hold on and it keeps going; re-engaging from a full release
            requires holding both again.
        engage_max_vel: Starting joint-velocity cap (rad/s) for the
            trapezoidal filter when teleop is first engaged after a rest-pose
            trajectory (startup or reset). Softens the transition from rest
            pose to the first IK target: the cap smoothsteps from this value
            up to ``teleop_max_vel`` over ``engage_duration`` seconds, so the
            arm starts gentle and opens up progressively (a hard restore used
            to release the error accumulated during the slow phase all at
            once). Defaults to ``reset_speed`` for a consistent feel.
        engage_duration: Seconds over which the velocity cap ramps from
            ``engage_max_vel`` to ``teleop_max_vel`` after the post-rest
            engage rising edge.
        teleop_max_vel: Maximum joint velocity (rad/s) enforced by the
            trapezoidal filter during normal teleoperation.  Limits how fast
            any single joint can move toward a new IK target.  Defaults to
            1.0 rev/s (~360 °/s).
        teleop_max_accel: Maximum joint acceleration (rad/s²) enforced by the
            trapezoidal filter.  Defaults to 3.5 rev/s² (~1260 °/s²).  Since
            the filter became a critically damped linear tracker, smoothness
            comes from the tracker itself, not this clamp: replaying recorded
            teleop showed resonance-band excitation identical at 2.0 and
            3.5 rev/s², while the lower cap saturated ~4% of moving time —
            felt as lag-then-surge "jumpiness" on fast moves (vibration
            windows correlated 5.5× with saturation). Keep it high enough
            that genuine motion never saturates; it is a safety ceiling.
        ik_alpha: Blend factor for the exponential moving average applied to
            the IK output before the trapezoidal filter.  Range ``(0, 1]``
            where ``1.0`` disables smoothing.  Lower values kill more
            high-frequency jitter at the cost of a small fixed lag
            (``~(1-alpha)/alpha`` frames).  Defaults to ``0.3`` (~20 ms lag
            at 120 Hz), favouring smoothness over minimum latency.
        pose_cutoff: Pole frequency (Hz) of the lag-compensated low-pass
            applied to raw VR controller positions, quaternions, and elbow
            positions **before** they enter the IK solver (see
            :class:`~almond_axol.teleop.filter.LagCompensatedLowPass` for why
            this replaced the One Euro filter, and for the real-session
            replay that set this value and the filter's lag-compensation
            fraction).  Lower values reject more tremor but the trade is
            steep — the raw stream's 3-12 Hz noise grows with hand speed
            and sits barely 1.5 octaves above intentional motion — so this
            stage only trims the band (~81% pass at 2.5 Hz); the resonance
            itself is handled by pose-tracked host damping on the robot
            side.
        position_multiplier: Scale factor applied to the controller's
            **position** displacement (not orientation) when mapping hand
            motion to the end-effector target.  ``1.0`` is 1:1 motion;
            ``2.0`` moves the arm twice as far as the hand, which helps cover
            the robot's full reach when the arm is longer than the operator's.
            Applied to both the end-effector and elbow position deltas so the
            arm posture scales coherently.  Defaults to ``1.0``.
        rotation_multiplier: Scale factor applied to the controller's
            **orientation** displacement (not position) when mapping hand
            motion to the end-effector target.  The relative rotation of the
            controller since engage is converted to axis-angle and its angle
            is scaled by this factor; ``1.0`` is 1:1 motion, ``2.0`` rotates
            the end-effector twice as far as the wrist.  Defaults to ``1.0``.
        disengage_timeout: Auto-disengage when no VR pose frame has arrived
            for this many seconds while teleop is engaged — the operator left
            VR (headset doffed, session exited without pressing X/Y) or the
            link dropped.  Without it the engage toggle survives the gap, so
            the next frames after re-entering VR are tracked against the old
            engage snapshot and the arms jerk toward wherever the controllers
            now are.  After the disengage the arms hold position wherever
            they are — a lost link never moves the robot on its own — until
            the operator deliberately re-engages (a fresh engage snapshot, so
            motion resumes relative to the controllers' new pose) or presses
            reset.  The headset streams poses at 72+ Hz while presenting,
            so anything beyond a few hundred ms is a real gap, not jitter.
            ``0`` disables the timeout.  Defaults to ``0.5`` s.
        record: File prefix for the teleop flight recorder (see
            :mod:`almond_axol.teleop.recorder`).  A bare name (``rec1``)
            records into ``~/.almond/recordings/``, where ``axol
            motion.build`` finds it; a path prefix (``/tmp/jit``) is used
            verbatim.  When set, every stage of the teleop pipeline — raw
            VR pose, filtered pose, IK output, smoothed command, measured
            joints, and the Rust core's motor-facing command/torque internals
            — is captured to ``<prefix>_{ik,cmd,meas,rt}.npz``. The measured
            and Rust stages run at the native 240 Hz core rate. The capture
            covers the **latest engage→disengage segment** (last ~5 minutes
            of it): recording starts at engagement, Python stages write on
            disengage, the compact Rust stage finalizes when the core disarms,
            and re-engaging starts the segment over. The same prefix overwrites
            on the next run. For ``axol
            motion.build`` or ``axol diag.offline``.  ``None`` (the
            default) disables recording entirely.
        absolute_mode: Mantis mapping. Instead of re-applying
            controller *deltas* onto the robot's engage-time FK pose (normal
            teleop), the engage rising edge solves a world-anchored robot
            **base transform** — gravity-aligned, positioned/oriented so the
            rest-pose FK gripper poses coincide with the two controllers'
            current poses — and every subsequent frame maps the controller
            pose 1:1 into that fixed base frame as an absolute IK target.
            Engaging is therefore the alignment act: the operator holds both
            grippers at the agreed start pose (matching the robot's rest
            pose relative to the task scene) and squeezes both grips. The
            offset between each controller and its gripper TCP is applied from
            ``tcp_transform_left/right`` when known. Without that transform,
            the engage snapshot aligns the starting pose only; later poses are
            mount-dependent and unsuitable for production collection. Elbow
            hints are ignored in this mode — human
            elbow positions say nothing about the robot's preferred null-space
            posture. ``position_multiplier`` / ``rotation_multiplier`` do not
            apply (the mapping is 1:1 by construction). Defaults to ``False``.
        base_height: Optional fixed height (metres) of the robot base origin
            above the VR floor (the WebXR ``local-floor`` reference space) in
            ``absolute_mode``. When set, the engage-time base fit pins the
            base's vertical position to it — matching the robot's real
            mounting height so datasets stay consistent across operators of
            different heights. ``None`` (default) lets the fit take the
            vertical position from the held grippers.
        tcp_transform_left: Tracker→gripper SE(3) transform for the left rig
            as ``[x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw]`` (gripper frame expressed in the
            tracker's local frame) — the rig's factory design constant, or a
            per-unit override from ``~/.almond/mantis/tcp_transform.json``.
            When set, ``absolute_mode`` maps each tracked pose through it —
            recorded TCP poses become mount-independent and wrist rotations
            stop smearing into position error. ``None`` falls back to a
            start-pose-only engage alignment, which is useful for bring-up but
            not production Cartesian data.
        tcp_transform_right: Same for the right rig.
        tracker_key: Quest controller datum key (for example
            ``"quest:meta-quest-touch-plus:grip"``). Hardware sources always
            resolve their distinct left/right ``survive:<id>`` or
            ``ultimate:<mac>`` bindings from tracker config; one singular key
            cannot safely identify both devices. ``None`` (default) selects a
            sole saved Quest profile when unambiguous.
        quest_controller_profile: Expected WebXR controller profile for a
            calibrated Quest rig (for example ``"oculus-touch-v3"``). A
            profile-scoped transform key of the form
            ``quest:<profile>:<space>`` fills this automatically. Absolute
            tracking fails closed when a connected controller reports a
            different profile or omits profile metadata.
        quest_pose_space: Expected WebXR controller pose datum: ``"grip"``
            for production Mantis capture, or ``"target-ray"`` only for
            uncalibrated compatibility bring-up. Filled from a profile-scoped
            Quest transform key alongside ``quest_controller_profile``.
        urdf_viewer_world_aligned: Whether the active pose producer's world is
            registered to the viewer headset's local-floor world. ``None``
            chooses True for Quest and False for Lighthouse/Ultimate. External
            tracker sessions keep the Quest video/HUD viewer useful but hide
            the spatial URDF overlay unless an operator explicitly asserts an
            out-of-band world registration.

    """Force the Mantis mapping/faithfulness profile in place.

    Shared by ``collect-data --mantis`` and ``teleop --mantis`` so the two flows
    behave identically: ``absolute_mode`` (the engage squeeze is the start-pose
    alignment act), toggle-style lock semantics, and transparent smoothing —
    the EMA and trapezoid filters exist to protect a physical arm and only add
    lag between the solution and where the hand actually was, so with no arm to
    protect the joints should follow the raw IK output. Managed bridges use an
    acknowledged low→high edge when automatically freezing or re-engaging, so
    ``hold_to_engage`` must be disabled; otherwise that required low release
    would act as a dead-man disengage. The pose low-pass cutoff is raised for
    the same reason: its rest-tremor smoothing costs lag at slow speeds, which
    on the rig is pure pose↔image misalignment (and visible slack in the
    headset's URDF overlay); a higher cutoff keeps the solution pinned to the
    hand at the price of passing through a little tremor.

    Also resolves the tracker→gripper transform per side into
    ``tcp_transform_left`` / ``tcp_transform_right``, first match wins:

    factory design transform for the tracker family
    (:data:`~almond_axol.mantis.calibration.DESIGN_TCP_TRANSFORMS` — a design
    constant, so it applies out of the box). A legacy unkeyed override is
    considered only when no active source is declared; a Mantis run never
    applies a transform measured with an unknown tracker. A tracker with none
    of these is warned about loudly: the session
