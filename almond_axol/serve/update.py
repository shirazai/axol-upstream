"""User-initiated update for ``axol serve`` installed as a uv tool.

The hosted installer (``curl https://axol.almond.bot/install | bash``) installs
the package with ``uv tool install`` from PyPI, pinned to the version of the
latest GitHub release (the release workflow publishes every release to PyPI),
and runs ``axol serve`` under a systemd service with ``Restart=always``. This
module surfaces, to the control panel, whether a newer release exists and lets
the operator apply the update on demand:

- :meth:`SelfUpdater.status` answers the polled control-panel indicator. It
  reports the installed version and the highest release tag (resolved by a
  read-only ``git ls-remote --tags`` against the repository, debounced and
  cached), so the UI can show "update available" and a button. Nothing upgrades
  as a side effect of this check. An update is offered only when a release tag
  with a *higher* version than the installed one exists -- commits landing on
  ``main`` between releases are invisible to installs.
- :meth:`SelfUpdater.start` is the Update button. It reinstalls the tool pinned
  to the newest release's version from PyPI; once the reinstall succeeds, the
  process exits so systemd restarts it on the new code. The UI then
  hard-reloads. Hosts originally installed from GitHub (pre-PyPI releases)
  migrate to the PyPI artifact on their next update through the same path.

Because the reinstall rebuilds the tool environment, anything that isn't a
declared PyPI dependency is dropped and must be reinstalled before we restart
onto the new code (pyzed, PyGObject), along with the patched zedxonesrc/zedsrc
plugins. Rather than enumerate those steps here, this just shells out to ``axol
provision --require-rt`` -- the single provisioning path the hosted installer
also runs, so the two can't drift. Its optional hardware steps are idempotent
and self-gating; the flag makes a required RT build or capability failure block
the restart instead of remaining warning-only.

Provision runs with ``--no-reboot``: when a step only takes effect at boot (a
new ZED Box camera driver, say) the updater *reboots the host* in place of the
service restart, under the same idle gate, so the new driver is live when the
panel reconnects. The startup heal does the same.

Only a required provisioning failure (the ``axol-rt`` core) blocks the
restart. A provision spawned by serve succeeds when just optional features
(Lighthouse tracking, the patched camera plugins) failed, naming them on a
final line that :meth:`SelfUpdater.status` reports as ``warning``.

Both steps are bounded (``_UV_INSTALL_TIMEOUT_S``, ``_PROVISION_TIMEOUT_S``):
a step that hangs ends the update in an error the panel can retry, rather
than an "updating" state that refuses every retry until the service restarts.
Their full output is appended to ``/var/log/almond-axol/<step>.log``, and a
failing step's tail is echoed to the service log.

The read-only ``git ls-remote --tags`` indicator is deliberately separate from
the *destructive* reinstall: the reinstall rebuilds (and so prunes
pyzed/PyGObject from) the env on every run, so it only runs when the operator
explicitly asks. The cheap ``ls-remote`` can poll freely without touching the
steady-state install.

Provisioning runs both after an upgrade *and* once at startup. The startup run
matters for a host that upgraded *into* the GStreamer-pipeline build from an
older release: that upgrade was performed by the *old* code, which knew nothing
about this provisioning path -- so the new code self-heals on its first
control-panel contact after the restart.

Dev checkouts (``uv run axol serve`` from a clone) are untouched: the package
metadata then points at a local directory, not an index or git install, and
the updater no-ops.
