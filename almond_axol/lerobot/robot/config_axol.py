                          ``select_assigned_cameras`` drops the rest. On the
                          CLI the dict is one inline YAML/JSON value (e.g.
                          ``--robot_config.cameras "{overhead: {serial:
                          41234567}}"``).
        axol_config:      Per-joint gain config forwarded to the Axol hardware driver.
        observe_torques:  Include joint torques in observations. Default False.
        observe_cartesian: Use Cartesian space for both observations and
                          actions: each arm's end-effector is a 6-axis pose
                          (position + axis-angle rotation, world frame FLU) plus
                          gripper position, instead of the 7 arm joint angles
                          (the gripper is kept either way). Observations run
                          forward kinematics on the joint state; Cartesian
                          actions are resolved back to joint targets via inverse
                          kinematics in send_action. Default False.
        left_channel:     SocketCAN interface for the left arm.
