"""
Axol robot as a LeRobot Robot.

AxolRobot wraps the async Axol hardware driver behind LeRobot's synchronous
Robot interface. A background thread runs a dedicated asyncio event loop so
Rust-core telemetry keeps streaming while get_observation() and send_action()
block synchronously on the calling thread.

Typical usage::

    from almond_axol.lerobot.robot import AxolRobot, AxolRobotConfig
    from almond_axol.lerobot.camera import ZedCameraConfig

    config = AxolRobotConfig(
        id="axol_01",

            "right_arm": ZedCameraConfig(serial=41234569),

    )
    with AxolRobot(config) as robot:

        The frame set is anchored on the **newest exposure every camera has
        already delivered**, not on "now": each camera pipeline (Argus → VIC →
        shared memory) adds its own latency, and the earlier
        ``read_at_or_after(perf_counter())`` per camera waited that latency
        out for *every* camera in turn — one tick cost the sum of the pipeline
        delays and the loop ran at 3-8 Hz instead of the policy's 60, while the
        frames it got were still exposed tens of milliseconds apart (each
        camera's first frame after a different "now"). The 2026-09-14 DAgger
        session recorded exactly that, plus the recorder discarding takes
        because the control loop stopped publishing state for whole seconds.

        Now the tick copies nothing until it knows the anchor: the slowest
        pipeline's newest exposure. Every other camera has that exposure (or
        its neighbour) in its shared-memory history already
        (:meth:`RawFrameReader.read_nearest`), so the set is built without
        waiting and its spread is the cameras' real exposure offset. Nothing
        waits for freshness either: while the anchor has not moved on from
        the last set built, that set is served again (:class:`_PolicyObservation`
        — frames plus the joints selected at their exposure, one consistent
        pair). The relay's policy ring runs below the control rate by design
        (``policy_fps``: inference reads an observation a few times a second,
        and a capture-rate ring cost a third VIC pass per camera plus a 60 Hz
        RGB copy per source in the relay), so at 60 Hz most ticks are
        re-serves and cost two header reads per camera. The recorder's
        per-tick snapshot is published by the loop from the live joint state,
        not from this observation. A camera whose newest frame is older than
        a couple of ring periods is silent and fails the observation, as a
        timed-out ``read_at_or_after`` did before. Cameras without a history
        (an in-process ZED reader) contribute their newest frame.

        Alignment is best effort, not a precondition: when a camera's ring has
        no frame near the anchor (it dropped that exposure) the observation
        takes the nearest frame it does retain — its newest, if the history
        does not reach the anchor at all — and the resulting skew is counted
        and reported by :class:`_PolicySkewMonitor` rather than failing the
        tick. A skipped tick sends no action and publishes no state, which is
        how a lossy relay ring turned into slow, stepping arm motion and
        discarded takes on 2026-09-14; a couple of frames of skew on one
        camera costs the policy nothing comparable.
