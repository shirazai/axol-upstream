"""``Axol`` — the Axol robot, with its control loop in the Rust realtime core.

This is the production robot object (re-exported as
:class:`almond_axol.robot.Axol`). Its public surface is the classic one —
``connect`` / ``enable`` / ``disable`` / ``disconnect``, the ``get_*`` /
``set_*`` register calls, telemetry, ``motion_control`` — and it owns the
low-level :class:`~almond_axol.robot.axol.AxolHardware` (buses, motors,
model math) as an implementation detail. What changed is behind the scenes:
while enabled, the CAN buses are owned by the ``axol-rt`` subprocess:

- ``enable()`` runs the split bring-up: the core resets the *cold* motors
  (prep — joints already enabled and holding are left untouched, exactly
  as the classic idempotent enable attaches to them), then Python resolves
  joint offsets and MyActuator decode ranges through a Rust maintenance
  proxy. That proxy exits before the realtime core enables
  and holds, making the core the sole CAN owner while armed. ``Motor`` caches
  fill from the core's per-tick telemetry packets — ~480 packet decodes/s
  replacing ~7,700 Python frame dispatches/s on this CPU-starved Jetson.
- ``motion_control()`` runs the slow model math from
  ``AxolArm.motion_control`` (limits, gravity, the pose *scheduling* of the
  fast terms) and a command sink ships per-joint tuples to the core instead
  of sending CAN from Python.

- The gripper is brought up by Python before the core arms (the classic
  enable/calibrate or attach/restore flow — it needs the quiet bus), then
  driven by the core: ``motion_control``'s slot-7 tuple carries its
  POSITION_FORCE command (motor-frame target, speed limit, torque limit).
- The *fast* physics all run in the core, per 240 Hz tick, from its own
  trajectory and feedback states: a golden-ported trapezoid tracker chases
  the latest target (replacing linear interpolation) — carried forward along
  the stream's own velocity for up to 80 ms when this side's tick is late,
  so a Python stall renders as smooth motion rather than a stop-then-lunge
  (``filter::Holdover``) —, the classic 20 rad/s
  command-derivative chain computes smooth friction/inertia feedforwards
  from that executed trajectory (friction params ride the config; the
  pose-scaled ``j_eff`` rides each target), and band-passed velocity damping
  applies the streamed pose-scheduled coefficients against the latest
  feedback within one core tick.
  Computing the damping torque in Python put it ~14 ms behind the motion —
  past 90° of loop phase in the shoulder burst band, where a damper pumps
  instead of damps (the rt-teleop shaking of 2026-08-27; see
  rust/axol-rt/src/filter.rs). Python's own trapezoid (with the engage
  velocity ramp and the output guard) still shapes the 120 Hz target
  stream; the core's tracker re-renders it at wire rate with 1.5x headroom
  on the limits.

Guarded return works exactly as in classic mode: ``torque_residuals`` and
``reset_command_state`` only touch the telemetry-filled caches and local
state, and ``gravity_compensate`` streams its tuples through the same
command sink, so the contact watchdog, the limp contact hold, and the
replanned reset all run against the core.

Faults never drop the arms. When the core loses trust in a motor (silent
for a second) it goes *limp* — every arm joint at kp = 0 with the streamed
gravity feedforward, still serving — and reports ``limp: ...``. Bad control
timing never does: it only degrades (host damping off, logged). ``motion_control`` then streams gravity comp instead
of tracking, so the arms stay weightless and hand-guidable while the
operator moves them to rest and stops the session; ``disable`` leaves them
limp rather than torquing off. A hard fault (dead bus, protocol error) or a
core that cannot ack the disarm leaves the motors holding their last
command instead. See the Safety notes in ``rust/axol-rt/src/serve.rs``.

                           partial bench arm); ``None`` means the full arm.
            right_joints:  Same for the right arm.

                without a fresh one before treating the host as gone.
            max_vel: Teleop joint-velocity cap (rad/s) — the core's tracker

            max_accel: Teleop joint-acceleration cap (rad/s²), same

            tracking_profile: ``default`` keeps target holdover and overrun
                smoothing. ``mink`` selects literal targets,
