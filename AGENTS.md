## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Overview

Almond Axol is a Python CLI + SDK for the Almond Axol dual-arm robot. Since no physical robot hardware is available in the cloud VM, all development and testing uses the **sim** mode (`--sim`), which renders the robot in a browser via viser.

### Running the application

- **Sim teleop** (the primary way to exercise the app without hardware): `uv run --extra jax --extra sim axol teleop --sim`
 - Opens a viser 3D viewer at `http://localhost:8002` and a VR WebSocket server on port 8000.
 - With no VR headset connected the arms just hold the rest pose. To actually drive them, either use the `Sim` SDK directly (`sim.motion_control(left=..., right=...)`, see the `Sim` docstring in `almond_axol/robot/sim.py`) or connect a WebSocket client to `wss://localhost:8000/ws` (self-signed cert — disable TLS verification) and stream `VRFrame` JSON with both `l_lock`/`r_lock` true to engage tracking.
 - The viser server persists engage/IK state across teleop restarts only within one process; if a WebSocket client leaves tracking engaged and reconnects, restart the `teleop` process for a clean engage.

### Web front-end (second product)

The browser UIs live under `web/` (a Vite + React monorepo: the WebXR `/vr` teleop app and the `/control` panel served by `axol serve`). Node 22 is available; `web/` is **not** covered by `uv sync`. Standard install/build/dev commands are in `web/README.md` (build the `packages/axol-vr-client` workspace before `app`).

### Linting

- `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .` — ruff is not a project dependency; it's pinned in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (see the `rev:` field). Easiest: `uv tool install pre-commit && pre-commit run --all-files`, which uses the pinned version automatically. Or install ruff directly at the same version, e.g. `uv tool install ruff@0.9.7`.

### Testing

- Python unit tests live in `tests/` (mostly stdlib `unittest`, with some pytest-style modules): run the whole suite with `uv run pytest`, which also enforces the 30% branch-aware coverage floor from `pyproject.toml`. `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests` still works for the `unittest` modules. They run without hardware — hardware-facing modules are exercised through mocks — but several import optional backends and LeRobot at module level, so run them from `uv sync --extra sim --extra lerobot --extra jax --extra mink --dev`. Use `uv run --no-sync pytest` after this sync. The dedicated `Mink without JAX` CI job installs only `sim`, `lerobot`, and `mink` and exercises commands and kinematics without any JAX packages. Add a `tests/test_<module>.py` alongside behaviour changes. For anything the suite doesn't cover, validate by importing the package and exercising the `Sim`-based code paths.
- Run the web unit/component suite from `web/` with `npm test`; use `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, and `npm run build` for the remaining front-end gates. GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the Python and Web gates on every PR.
- MuJoCo supports `>=3.8.0,<3.12`; `almond_axol/robot/gravity.py` selects the 3.8/3.9 or 3.10/3.11 mass-matrix API. The `mink` extra pins MuJoCo 3.11.0 and QP dependencies for solver parity. Update gravity code, dependency bounds, and lock together for another API line; `tests/test_gravity.py` verifies both APIs.
- The Rust realtime core (`rust/axol-rt`, the required hardware control backend) has a `cargo test` suite: golden filter vectors pinned to the Python originals, wire-protocol round trips, and a damping dissipated-power comparison. `uv run python rust/axol-rt/tools/rt_proto_check.py` exercises the built binary's Unix-socket protocol without CAN. `cargo test stall_detection_live -- --ignored` needs the CAN interfaces up with motors unpowered.

### Dependency extras

| Extra | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `jax` | Default JAX IK and planning commands; required when using default kinematics settings |
| `mink` | Mink tracking, Cartesian observations, and reset/return without JAX; select Mink in session configuration |
| `sim` | viser (browser 3D visualizer) — needed for sim mode |
| `lerobot` | LeRobot data collection/policy — requires hardware + ZED cameras. Not needed for teleop camera streaming: the ZED SDK cameras live in `almond_axol/video/zed_sdk.py` and `almond_axol/lerobot/camera` only wraps them in LeRobot's `Camera`/`CameraConfig` |

For cloud development: `uv sync --extra sim --extra lerobot --extra jax --extra mink --dev`. For a Mink-only deployment, use `uv sync --extra sim --extra lerobot --extra mink` and select the Mink backend in the session configuration. JAX is optional; `jax`, `jaxlib`, `jaxlie`, `jaxls`, and `pyroki` must not be required by Mink workflows.

**On a real robot (Jetson/tegra host), never run a bare `uv sync --extra sim`.** The robot's venv also carries the `lerobot` extra plus out-of-band installs — `pyzed` (from `~/.almond/wheels/`) and PyGObject (`pygobject>=3.50,<3.52`, built against the system gobject-introspection) — and an exact sync silently removes them, which kills camera streaming (no `pyzed` for the SDK fallback — teleop logs a `zed.install` hint — and no `gi` for the gst relay) and data collection (`No module named 'lerobot'`). Restore with `uv sync --extra sim --extra lerobot --extra mink` (or `--extra jax` for a JAX installation) then `uv pip install ~/.almond/wheels/pyzed-*.whl "pygobject>=3.50,<3.52"`. Do **not** install the self-built `jaxlib` / `jax_cuda12_*` wheels from `~/.almond/wheels/` — they were compiled against cuDNN 9.8 while JetPack ships 9.3, so the IK worker's first solve crashes (`RET_CHECK failure ... dnn_support != nullptr`); the lock's CPU jaxlib runs IK at full teleop rate.

### Gotchas

- Python 3.13+ is required (`.python-version` pins `3.13`). The VM ships with 3.12; use `uv python install 3.13` if needed.
- The `uv` package manager must be on PATH (`$HOME/.local/bin`).
- Hardware-dependent commands (`can.setup`, `motor.*`, `gravity-comp`, `tune.*`, `zed.*`, `collect-data`, `collect-dagger`, `run-policy`) will fail without physical robot/CAN bus — this is expected.
